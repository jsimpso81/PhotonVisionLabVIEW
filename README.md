## Installs

### Installation

There are a number of prerequisites needed before installing this library.
1. Install the FRC version of LabVIEW.  (If only the utility programs are desired, LabVIEW may not need to be installed.  However this has **NOT** been tested.)
1. Install the FRC game tools

Download the latest install package.  These can be found in the **Releases** section of the github repository.  Here is a direct link.  https://github.com/jsimpso81/PhotonVisionLabVIEW/releases/latest

Select the *.nipkg* installation file for the version of LabVIEW being used, then double click it, or right click and select install.  Administrative privledges will be needed to perform this installation.  Follow the instructions.  Usually selection of all the default answers is sufficient.  Installation should take 5 minutes or less.

Previous versions do not have to be uninstalled prior to installing a new version.  The new version will automatically upgrade the older version.

### Removal

To uninstall, open NI Package Manager.  Select the *Installed* tab.  Find and highlight  **JAS_Junk_FRC_TrajLib**.  Then click the *REMOVE* button.  The uninstall should start. It should take 5 minutes or less.

## Reporting Issues

Use the github issues menu to submit information on issues and suggested enhancements.  
I'll attempt to deal with issues in a reasonable time, but there are no guarantees.

When submitting an issue, please follow these guidelines:
- Make certain you are using the latest version of the library.  If not, install the latest version and see if the issue still occurs.
- See if the issue has already been reported.  If so, add any new details to the existing issue.
- Write a very detailed specific description of the problem.
- Include any screen shots or other data needed to show the issue.
- Describe exactly how to reproduce the error.  (Likely, I can't try this on your robot...)
- If possible, try and condense the problem to a small test program that isolates the issue.
- If you found a work around, please include it for others to use.
See ![Contributing.md!](Contributing.md) for additional details.

## Contributing

Contributions of enhancements, bug fixes, and new routines are welcome.  If new routines are not already part of the C++/Java PhotonVision, then it seems fair that they should be written solely by FRC student members, with confirmation from a mentor on their team to be able to be candidates for inclusion.  See ![Contributing.md!](Contributing.md) for additional details.
